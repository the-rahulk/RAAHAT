        <p >So let's come straight to the point, you are here to connect your static page form to a backend. We use the trick of using the GET to make a POST (Wow!)
           <br/>
        But let's start from the beginning.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="main">
       <section class="main-section">
           <h2>Creating a Project</h2>

           <p>
               Every integration begins with what we very creatively (sarcasm of course) named 'Project'. When you create a project, do keep the following in mind:
               <ul>
                   <li>Name your project aptly - We have no constraint of having a unique name. We identify by an ID, as you shall see shortly</li>
                   <li>Give a brief description for your reference</li>
                   <li>Now this is VERY IMPORTANT: While adding the Endpoint URL, make sure to add the Protocol as well i.e. `http://` or `https://` Otherwise, the connection would not work</li>
                   <li>For the fields, we allow a minimum of 1 and maximum of 5 for a particular project. Leave the other fields blank if you don't want to assign them. You can of course, change this later</li>
               </ul>                   
           </p>
       </section>
       <section class="main-section">
           <h2>Setting up the Form in Static Site</h2>
           <p>
               There's some pre-requisites to using Beyond Static to your form, you must have jQuery CDN in your project. 
               <br />
               If you're confused, you may add it from <a target="_blank" href="https://code.jquery.com">here</a>.
               <br />
               Now, we encrypt the incoming input using our code below:
           </p>
           
          
           <div>
               <ul class="info">
                   <li>Notice the function sendMessage called after the form is submitted in <a href="https://aayush-choudhary.github.io/contact.html" target="_blank">Contact Me</a></li>
                   <li>It takes the values of Name, Mail and Message and gets the encrypted link by passing to <code>encryptAndSend("LionArt", 3, name, email, message)</code> where the syntax is <code>encryptAndSend(:(username), :(projectID), :(field1 value), :(field2 value), :(field3 value), :(field4 value), :(field5 value))</code></li>
                   <li>If you only have say 3 fields, your function shall look like: <code>encryptAndSend(:(username), :(projectID), :(field1 value), :(field2 value), :(field3 value))</code></li>
                   <li>This returns you a URL, where we redirect the page to, see lines 87-91 of Aayush's integrateBack.js</li>
                   <li>This would then send the data to our servers who would store it for you and redirect user back to the Endpoint URL specified in the project.</li>
                   <li>Come back to your Project and the message would be added.</li>
                   <li>Yes, it's a bit tedious the first time, but hey, its super-cool and gets simple with use.</li>
                   <li>If you face any issue, you may contact <a href="/aboutus" target="_blank">any of us</a>.</li>
               </ul>
           </div>
       </section>
       <div>
           So that's it. That's how you shall integrate Beyond Static to your Website. In a further update, we shall demonstrate how this can even be achieved in a Python Script. Till then, keep exploring!
